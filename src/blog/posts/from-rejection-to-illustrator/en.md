## When Numbers Stopped Inspiring Me

For a long time, I worked in finance — an environment where precision, analytics, and impeccable logic matter most. But even there, I stood out through presentations: structuring complex data, turning numbers into clear stories, and visually communicating ideas in a way that truly worked.

Over time, it became clear that my strength wasn't just in calculations, but in how I present results. This realization pushed me to move forward and build my own practice, where my visual communication skills became the primary tool.

## The Dream: Working as a Real Designer

When I first started looking for a new career, I targeted positions where I could combine my finance experience with what truly brought me joy — visual storytelling. I explored roles in branding, presentations, visual communication, and creating materials that help companies speak to their audience clearly.

The idea of working in a design studio appealed to me — a place that values creativity, attention to detail, and the ability to transform complex data into expressive visual solutions. I wanted to participate in projects creating brand identity, packaging, presentations, and illustrations — everything that shapes a brand's image and influences how products are perceived.

I expected studio work would give me more creative freedom, let me collaborate with other designers, and show me how my skills could make projects brighter, clearer, and stronger. It was exactly this combination of analytical experience and visual thinking that I wanted to develop further.

## 20 Rejections: The Moment That Changed Everything

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia, please add your text about:
- How many interviews did you go through?
- What reasons did they give for rejecting you?
- Which rejection was the most memorable?
- What did you feel after the 10th, 15th, 20th rejection?
- What was the turning point — when did you decide "I'm doing this on my own"?
This is the most important section — it's what hooks readers and drives Google traffic.
-->

The job search turned into a marathon of rejections. Every interview started with hope and ended with a polite "we chose another candidate." After the twentieth rejection, it became clear: the system wasn't ready to accept someone from a different background, no matter how strong their portfolio was.

That's when I made the decision that changed everything: if the market won't give me a chance — I'll create that chance myself.

## First Steps in Freelancing

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia, add details:
- How did you find your first client?
- What was your very first paid project?
- How long between deciding to freelance and the first paid project?
- What were your fears and doubts?
-->

Freelancing didn't start with big commissions — it started with small steps: first logos, first labels, first clients found through word of mouth. Every project was an opportunity to prove — not to employers, but to myself — that my skills had real value.

## Building Real Partnerships

In freelancing, I quickly learned the key difference from employment: it's all about the work itself. In job interviews, I was judged by my resume and a few minutes of conversation. With clients, what matters is the quality of visual solutions, speed, and understanding of the brief. And that became the foundation for building genuine partnerships.

One of my first clients was **Star Food** — they needed labels for a new product line. The project went well, and they entrusted me with logo development, then the creation of a complete visual concept. We now collaborate on an ongoing basis.

**Baloon Party** came to me for a comprehensive brand book — from visual identity to structure and all corporate style elements. And the collaboration with **Laser Craft** started with a logo and gradually grew into a long-term partnership covering all their graphic and visual needs.

## From Design to Book Illustration

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia, share:

Working with brands gave me confidence and a professional foundation. But alongside that, a desire was growing to tell stories — not through logos and labels, but through entire worlds populated with characters. That's how I came to children's book illustration.

Today my portfolio includes six book projects: The Nutcracker, The Wild Swans, Winter Adventures, Magic World, Sigurd, and Sea Secrets. Each one represents months of work, dozens of sketches, and an endless search for the right visual language for every story.

## What I've Learned Along the Way

Twenty rejections taught me more than any job interview ever could:

Rejection is not a verdict — it's a redirection. Every "no" brought me closer to my own path, which turned out to be far more interesting than any staff position.

Clients value results, not diplomas. Not one of my regular clients has ever asked where I studied. What matters to them is one thing — the quality of work and the ability to understand their brief.

Long-term partnerships are built on trust. Star Food, Baloon Party, Laser Craft — all of them started with one small project. Quality work turned one-time orders into ongoing collaboration.
