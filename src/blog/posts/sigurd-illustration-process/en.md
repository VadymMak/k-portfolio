## How a Children's Book Illustration Is Born

This is the question I get asked most often. Today I'll show you the entire journey — from the first pencil sketch to the finished book spread — using my project "Sigurd Fights the Dragon" as an example.

It's a Scandinavian legend about a warrior hero, dwarf blacksmiths, a magic sword, and a battle with a dragon. The project required creating a unique visual world — with dark mountains, underground forges, and dragon caves.

## About the Project: The Book "Sigurd"

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia will tell about the project — who commissioned it, why Scandinavian mythology, how many pages, how long it took, what was the hardest part. 4–6 sentences. -->

## Stage 1: Color Palette

The first thing any project starts with is color. For each scene, I create a separate palette that conveys the mood of the moment. In "Sigurd," every chapter has its own color story.

The dwarf blacksmiths — warm earthy tones: olive, brown, gray. They create the feeling of an underground forge, heavy metal, and fire.

The dragon — deep purples, dark cherry, golden accents. Power, danger, and magic.

Landscapes and caves — cool blue-gray, lavender, steel tones. The world of Scandinavian mountains, mist, and stone.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia will add 2–3 sentences — how she chooses palettes, whether the palette changed during the project. -->

## Stage 2: Sketches and Composition

A sketch is the framework of the future illustration. At this stage, I work out the composition: where the hero stands, how the reader's eye moves, how much space to leave for text.

For each scene, I create several composition variants before choosing the final one. Here's what that looks like:

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia will add — how many sketches before the final version, what she draws with, which character was the hardest. -->

## Stage 3: From Lines to Color

The most magical moment — when a black-and-white sketch begins to come alive with color. This is the stage where characters come to life — light, volume, and atmosphere appear.

Watch the transformation — the same scene as a sketch and in its final version:

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Anastasiia will add — what tools she uses, how many hours per illustration, what she loves most about this stage. -->

## Bonus: Free Coloring Pages for Kids

Every sketch is a ready-made coloring page. I've prepared 4 coloring pages from the "Sigurd" project — your kids can color the dwarf blacksmiths, the dragon, and Sigurd himself in their own colors!

Download for free as PDF — just print and draw!

## What You Can Learn from This Process

Every illustration in a children's book isn't just one picture — it's the result of dozens of decisions: about color, composition, character personality, and the mood of the scene. That's why book illustration isn't a quick process. It's a journey.

If you're planning to publish a children's book and looking for an illustrator who will pour their heart into every page — let's discuss your project.
